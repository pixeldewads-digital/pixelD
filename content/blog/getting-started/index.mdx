Welcome to your new PixelDew project! This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how you can use MDX to create rich content.

## What's Included?

This project is a full-featured e-commerce platform for digital products, built with a modern stack:

- **Next.js 15 App Router**: For a powerful, server-first framework.
- **Prisma & PostgreSQL**: For robust database management.
- **NextAuth.js v5**: For secure authentication.
- **Stripe**: For reliable payment processing.

You can write JSX directly in your markdown files. Here's an example of a simple component:

<div style={{ padding: '1rem', border: '1px solid #ccc', borderRadius: '8px' }}>
  This is a React component inside an MDX file!
</div>
